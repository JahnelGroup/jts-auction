# This is how you would override the default hibernate @NotNull message. The only reason
# this is even considered is because of our LocalValidatorFactoryBean defined in ValidationConfig which links

#
# Spring MVC provides a wonderful means to qualify down your message with codes but unfortunately
# this behavior does not work without Spring MVC.

# "codes": [
#   "NotNull.auction.name",
#   "NotNull.name",
#   "NotNull.java.lang.String",
#   "NotNull"
