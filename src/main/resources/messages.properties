## ${foo} is an EL expression (i.e., ${validatedValue}) see http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-interpolation-with-message-expressions
## {foo} is a message parameter that correlates to attributes on your annotation by name.

BidIncrement.message=Your bid of ${validatedValue} must be of {value} increments.

## Spring Validation
##
# Spring Mvc will resolve a list of error codes that you could also use to help narrow down
# the right message. Unfortunately this feature is not baked into the REST API processing and
# only available for true Spring MVC. I've added a bridge to this work

# In this case when the annotation was process the first argument is the name of the field.
NotNull.auction.name=Auction must have a {0}.
NotNull.bid.amount=Bid must have an amount.
BidTooLow=You must bid more than {0}.
BidAlreadyExists=You already have a bid.
